# TCMSP_AuotoDwonload_Mmultithreading
It can easily download the entire TCMSP data set.  
Because molecular virtual screening is required, it is necessary to use the components of traditional Chinese medicine from the TCMSP dataset. However, a complete download was not available on TCMSP, hence this Python program was created. It enables multi-threaded downloading of the entire TCMSP dataset, from MOL000001 to MOL014259. You simply need to install the requests library, then you can run it.  
```python  
pip3 install requests  
```
